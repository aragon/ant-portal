    'What is ANT v2?',
    <>
      <p>
        ANTv1 was optimized for on-chain voting. Because of that, the ANT smart
        contract needed more complex logic. As we are{' '}

          moving voting off-chain
        </Link>
        , that logic is not needed anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Switching to a new, simpler token will make ANT transactions 3x cheaper
        — lowering the barrier to entry and making it a better token to use.
        ANTv2 will also support gas-less transactions, enabling service
        operators (and delegated hot wallets) to pay for their users’ gas.
      </p>

    'Why should I migrate my ANT?',
    <>
      <p>
        ANTv2 is not a different token, but just a new version of ANT. If you
        have ANTv1, you will be able to easily upgrade it to ANTv2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with the upgrade, we will also kickstart a new{' '}
        <Link href="https://liquidity.aragon.org/">
          liquidity rewards program
        </Link>{' '}
        on both Uniswap and Balancer, starting October 29th.
      </p>
      <p>ANT holders who upgrade early will be eligible for:</p>

    'For how long will this migration last?',
    <p>
      Users will be able to use the Upgrade Portal as many times as they’d like.
      It will be continually supported going forward, ensuring that tokenholders
      are always using an up-to-date version of ANT. Each token upgrade
      currently costs about 200,000 gas (or around $2).
    </p>,
  ],
  [
    'What is the conversion rate?',
    <p>
      The conversion rate is fixed at 1:1, this means that you will get 1 ANTv2
      for every ANTv1 you upgrade.
    </p>,
  ],
  [
    'What happens to the ANT held in CEXs & DEXs?',
    <>
      <p>
        This tool is designed to help users upgrade ANTv1 balances held in their
        own wallets in just a few clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have ANT in major exchanges supporting the upgrade, including
        Binance, Huobi and OKEx, your ANT will be upgraded automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have ANTv1 staked in other contracts, such as liquidity pools and
        DEXes, you must upgrade your liquidity manually. In order to do so,
        first exit the existing pool, upgrade it through this portal and
        re-enter it into the equivalent ANTv2 pool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that most sites, coin trackers and DEXes will map ANTv1 to
        “ANT (old)” and ANTv2 to “ANT”.
